Explanation:
HTML Entities:

Replace < with &lt;
Replace > with &gt;
Replace { with &#123;
Replace } with &#125;
Replace = with &#61;
HTML Structure:

The <pre> tag preserves whitespace and formatting, making it ideal for displaying code.
The <code> tag is used to denote the code block.
JavaScript Code in HTML:

Ensure that JSX syntax within the HTML is properly escaped so that it doesnâ€™t break the HTML rendering.
